# Tableau
In this repository I have put all my past Tableau projects and experiences. Each of the files uploaded can be downloaded and viewed with Tableau. 

Below a few screenshots of one of the Projects in this repository.

The Project was a simple analysis of the Bike Rentals Data in the West coast of the USA. For the whole Tableau project, please download the file [Download Bike Rentals Data](Bike%20Rentals%20Data.twbx)

In a separate project:


OCD vs Age: This is a series of scatter plots for different music genres like Country, Gospel, Pop, and Rock, each plot showing individual data points that represent the OCD levels of individuals across different ages. There's a trend line in each plot that suggests the general trend of OCD levels in relation to age for fans of each genre. The overall implication seems to be that OCD levels tend to decrease with age. Insomnia, OCD Level vs Hours of Music per Day: This plot displays multiple horizontal bands, each corresponding to a favorite music genre like Hip hop, Classical, EDM, Rap, Jazz, K pop, Folk, and Country. Within each band, individual data points represent the relationship between the hours of music listened to per day and the levels of OCD and insomnia. The note suggests that while most genres correlate with higher levels of insomnia and OCD as playback time increases, Hip hop shows a trend of decreasing OCD levels with increased playback time.

Types of Music Effectiveness Chart: A treemap displaying various genres of music such as Rock, Metal, Classical, Hip hop, EDM, R&B, Folk, Rap, Jazz, Pop, Country, Video game music, K pop, and Lofi. The size of each block might represent the effectiveness of each genre in helping with the mentioned conditions. Depression Level vs. Hours of Music per Day Chart: A scatter plot showing a correlation between the number of hours spent listening to music per day and depression levels. Different music genres such as Classical, Country, EDM, Hip hop, and K pop are plotted, suggesting an association between longer hours of listening to certain genres and higher depression levels. Anxiety Level vs. BPM Chart: Another scatter plot indicating the relationship between the Beats Per Minute (BPM) of music in the Pop and EDM genres and anxiety levels. It implies that higher BPM is associated with higher anxiety, as shown by a trend line going upwards.
